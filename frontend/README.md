# Frontend Web Application

## Folder Structure

Each of the webpages are in the pages folder and the components that are within them are in the components folder.

## Functionality

Users can either create a room or join an existing room through the homepage buttons.
When joining a room, users must enter their name and the room ID.

Once inside a room, the members in the room will be displayed alongside the room ID.

Users can draw on the canvas and they can also choose the colour they would like to draw with.
